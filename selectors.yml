    #   Suggested testing implementation for the Snowplow Unified package. Lean approach, essential tests rather than full suite to save cost.
    #   Tests:
    #     - All tests on Snowplow Unified this_run and manifest tables.
    #     - Primary key and data tests on the Snowplow Unified derived tables (page_views, sessions and users)
    #     - All tests on any custom models in your dbt project, tagged with `snowplow_unified_incremental`.
