snowplow-unified 1.0.0 (2026-01-20)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version marks a major milestone as we move the package into a 1.0.0 release. This version introduces breaking changes to internal syntax to ensure compatibility with modern dbt core standards and prepares the codebase for future dbt fusion engine compatibility. This release does not include any model logic changes that would require a full refresh.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- We now require dbt version >=1.10.6 to run this package
- Redshift users are required to use >=1.10 dbt-redshift adapter
- Stricter YAML validation (for example, nesting all generic test arguments under arguments:)

## Under the hood
- Update package yml for v1.0.0 and bump dbt requirement

## Upgrading
Update the snowplow-unified version in your packages.yml file and upgrade your dbt version accordingly, if needed.
Redshift users should ensure they are running dbt-redshift >= 1.10.0. Follow our [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/unified/) to align profiles, tests, and any custom implementations with the stricter YAML requirements introduced in dbt Core 1.10+.

snowplow-unified 0.5.5 (2025-07-22)

snowplow-unified 0.5.2 (2025-02-26)
---------------------------------------

## Summary
This patch release targets two issues existing users reported: adding a duplication layer on the iso_639_3 seed that by default contains some duplicates to avoid possible duplicates in the sessions table, and using row_number based deduplicating instead of qualify for Redshift that on certain versions can slow or halt the query processing.

## Fixes
- Deduplicate iso_639_3 seed (Close #99)
- Use row_number to deduplicate in Redshift

## Upgrading
- Update the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file.

## Fixes
- Revised the field casting approach within Databricks/Spark to enhance data handling and compatibility.
- Removed the non-null constraint test on `user_identifier` to prevent unnecessary validation errors and allow for more flexible data integration.

## Upgrading
Update the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file to take advantage of these improvements.

snowplow-unified 0.4.1 (2024-05-13)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This feature updates our `default_channel_group` definition to support the use of `refr_` fields in the case that the `mkt_` fields are null. This is a requested feature in particular for landing pages with redirects. This functionality is turned off by default.

## Features
- New `snowplow__use_refr_if_mkt_null` variable to use `refr_` fields if `mkt_` ones are null in default channel group classification

## Fixes
- Fix an issue in the channel group classification where direct channels were sometimes ignored due to string checks

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file. 

snowplow-unified 0.4.0 (2024-03-25)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds a surrogate key to the conversions table, in case of an event being valid against multiple conversion types, and fixes an issue with bigquery if `snowplow` was in your project name.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Adds a new surrogate key to the optional conversions table, to allow for the same event to be part of multiple conversions

## Fixes
- Fix an issue where having `snowplow` in your project name caused issue when using a bigquery target

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file. If you already make use of the conversions table and wish to not do a full refresh, you can add the new column by following the migration guide [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/unified/#upgrading-to-040).

snowplow-unified 0.3.1 (2024-03-11)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release fixes an issue where it was not possible to full refresh a single table using the `models_to_remove` variable, as well as removing a non-valid tests on the conversions table.

## Fixes
- Fix missing argument in `snowplow_utils.snowplow_delete_from_manifest` call
- Remove null test on `user_id` in conversions table

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-unified 0.3.0 (2024-02-26)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds one major new feature, which is custom aggregations on the views, sessions, and users tables. You can read more about it in our docs [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/package-features/custom-aggregations/). We also added the ability to manage grants to all tables in the package via the `snowplow__grant_select_to` variable.

Under the hood we did a lot of small tweaks and improvements including prefixing all macro calls for easier custom models, moved cluster by fields to macros, ensure that the manifest tables are only full refreshed when `snowplow__allow_refresh` is set to true AND there is a full refresh flag on the run, and added a few context fields to the derived tables that were being discarded previously.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- We have changed the behavior of the `allow_refresh` macro so now if `snowplow__allow_refresh` is set to `true` it will only refresh the manifest models if the `--full-refresh` flag is also set. If you require the old behavior where it would refresh the manifest models on an incremental run when `snowplow__allow_refresh` was set to `true`, please overwrite this macro. See the [Overriding Macros](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-operation/macros-and-keys/#overriding-macros) guide for more details.
- Renamed `snowplow__page_view_passthroughs` to `snowplow__view_passthroughs` to be consistent with the rest of the package
- Minimum `snowplow-utils` version is now 0.16.2

## Features
- Add new passthrough aggregations to the views, sessions, and users table, enabled using `snowplow__view/session/user_aggregations`
- Reorder and add some additional context fields to derived tables (non-breaking change)
- Add `snowplow__custom_sql` to allow adding custom sql to the `snowplow_unified_base_events_this_run` and `snowplow_unified_events_this_run` models
- Add macro to define cluster-by for tables to allow users to overwrite this if required
- Add check for `--full-refresh` flag before allowing refresh of manifest models when `snowplow__allow_refresh` is set to `true`.
- Add ability to grant select to a list of users, principals or roles on tables created by the package using `snowplow__grant_select_to` for all warehouses except BigQuery  
- Add auto-grant of `usage` on schemas to `snowplow__grant_select_to`, can be disabled using `snowplow__grant_schema_usage` (see docs at https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/package-features/table-grants/)

## Fixes
- Fix a bug where if you ran the package in a period with no data, and had list all events enabled, the package would error rather than complete
- Fix incorrect tagging in app errors module tables

## Under the hood
- Prefix all macro calls with package name for easier customization
- Use macros for grouped fields (e.g. contexts) where possible
- Bump actions version numbers

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file, paying attention to the breaking changes above..

snowplow-unified 0.2.0 (2024-01-30)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds the ability to calculate mobile screen engagement using the screen summary context. There is also a new optional module for a conversions table. Other changes are the ability to stitch the users table during session stitching and heatset is a recognised platform now.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
Existing users on Snowflake / Databricks / Redshift will need to make changes to some of their derived tables. For a full sql script on how to achieve this, check out the relevant [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/unified/). The other option is to do a [complete refresh](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-operation/full-or-partial-refreshes/#complete-refresh-of-snowplow-package) of the package.
