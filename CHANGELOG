snowplow-unified 0.2.1 (2024-02-XX)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
XXX

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- We have changed the behavior of the `allow_refresh` macro so now if `snowplow__allow_refresh` is set to `true` it will only refresh the manifest models if the `--full-refresh` flag is also set. If you require the old behavior where it would refresh the manifest models on an incremental run when `snowplow__allow_refresh` was set to `true`, please overwrite this macro. See the [Overriding Macros](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-operation/macros-and-keys/#overriding-macros) guide for more details.
- Renamed `snowplow__page_view_passthroughs` to `snowplow__view_passthroughs` to be consistent with the rest of the package

## Features
- Add new passthrough aggregations to the views, sessions, and users table, enabled using `snowplow__view/session/user_aggregations`
- Reorder and add some additional context fields to derived tables (non-breaking change)
- Add `snowplow__custom_sql` to allow adding custom sql to the `snowplow_unified_base_events_this_run` and `snowplow_unified_events_this_run` models
- Add macro to define cluster-by for tables to allow users to overwrite this if required
- Add check for `--full-refresh` flag before allowing refresh of manifest models when `snowplow__allow_refresh` is set to `true`.
- Rename 

## Fixes
- Fix a bug where if you ran the package in a period with no data, and had list all events enabled, the package would error rather than complete

## Under the hood
- Prefix all macro calls with package name for easier customization
- Use macros for grouped fields (e.g. contexts) where possible
- Bump actions version numbers

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
